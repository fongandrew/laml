# Legal Agreement Markup Language

Legal Agreement Markup Language (LAML) is an extension of XML designed for legal agreements and related documents. Its goals are (a) to encourage legal documents to drafted as composable, re-usable modules and (b) to  lay the groundwork for encoding legal information as machine-readable data.

Please see the [Guide](https://github.com/fongandrew/laml/blob/master/README.md) for more details on how to construct a LAML document.
